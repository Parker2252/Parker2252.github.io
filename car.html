  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has had a profound impact on the automotive industry. With advancements in AI technology, cars are becoming smarter, safer, and more efficient.

<p>
  One notable application of AI in cars is autonomous driving. AI can use sensors to detect what is on the road and make split section decisions when sometimes huans would not be able to reatct to.
<p>
    AI does come with some problems such as what would happen to all of the data if a hacker was able to get in. Also could a hacker override the system and take contorl of the device?
